# RL-Sonic

## Description
This repository contains a reinforcement learning project focused on the Sonic the Hedgehog game. The aim is to develop an AI agent capable of playing Sonic, using reinforcement learning techniques and algorithms.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for dependency management and virtual environment.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/victordmor/rl-mario.git`
`cd rl-sonic`


2. Install the project dependencies using Poetry:

`poetry install`

This will create a virtual environment and install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

### Running the Project

To activate the virtual environment created by Poetry and run scripts within this environment, use:

`poetry shell`


Then, you can directly run your Python scripts, for example:

`python your_training_script.py`

To exit the virtual environment, type `exit`.
