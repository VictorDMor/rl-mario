1. Let's have a working agent
2. Scientific paper writing
    - Introduction, methodology
    - Analogy with self-driving cars
    - Problem presentation
    - RL algorithm used
    - Results & Future Work
3. If we have time, alternative algorithms to compare
    - Genetic algorithms
    - Brute-force algorithms
    - Create checkpoints to compare time complexity vs agent
