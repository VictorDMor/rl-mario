- X,Y Q-table doesn't work because of enemies? We should test it more.

Using only the (x, y) coordinates as the state in your Q-table might be too simplistic for a game like Super Mario Bros,
which has dynamic elements such as moving enemies. The (x, y) coordinates don't capture information about the enemies, 
so the agent might not learn how to interact with them effectively.

For example, if there's an enemy at a certain (x, y) location in one episode and not in another, the agent will treat 
these situations as the same because it only looks at the (x, y) coordinates. This could lead to the agent making suboptimal 
decisions, like jumping when there's no enemy or not jumping when there is an enemy.
